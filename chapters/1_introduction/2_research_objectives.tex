\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:research-objectives}
The goal of this research project is to evaluate various factors that affect performance and usability, among other things. Factors such as containerization, selection of WebAssembly runtime, and programming language will be emphasized. Considerations will be made regarding vendor lock-in, and potential strategies for avoiding it will be evaluated. Additionally, the paper will address interesting aspects such as sustainability in terms of resource conservation in the serverless domain. \\
\newline
Based on these requirements, the thesis aims to answer the following research question:
\begin{center}
\textit{"What are the effects of using WebAssembly technology in the serverless domain, particularly concerning the technologies employed (runtime environment, programming language), and how do they compare to existing solutions?"}
