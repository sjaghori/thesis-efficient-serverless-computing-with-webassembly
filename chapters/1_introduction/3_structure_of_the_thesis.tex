\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{sec:structure-of-the-thesis}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter 2} describes the current state of WebAssembly, including an overview of the current active WebAssembly proposals and the explanation of three important proposals. It also covers the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
  \item \textbf{Chapter 3} provides an overview of the existing WebAssembly runtimes. It also compares \gls{V8} isolates to WebAssembly runtimes.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 4} explores the design of a simple WebAssembly compute platform. It also describes the implementation of the platform and evaluates the initial performance results.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 5} includes everything related to the benchmarking, starting with the methodology and setup, followed by the results and discussion.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 6} discusses the vendor lock-in issues in a serverless environment. The chapter discusses design principles that can be used to mitigate some of the vendor lock-in issues.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 7} describes the related work in the area of a WebAssembly based serverless environment.
  % sustainability?
  \item \textbf{Chapter 8} concludes the thesis. It also discusses the aspects of platform limitations and sustainability in regards to the environment.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 9} outlines the future work that can be carried out based on the content of this thesis.
\end{itemize}
